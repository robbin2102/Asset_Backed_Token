# Asset Backed Tokens
### Problem statement

Real world assets (RWAs) are just $125B of a trillion dollar crypto ecosystem  with 99% TVL ($124B) concentrated on centralised stablecoins. The reason why only 12% of crypto tokens are backed by RWAs with high centralisation is because there is not way to attribute a real world asset to its on-chain tokens & because of this we cannot bring data or utilities of real world assets to blockchain.

For example- For example when you buy USDT, you lose access to your fiat money which moves to issuerâ€™s bank account. You loose trace about the condition of state of the underlying asset when it moves to a centralised issuers bank account. Similarly when users swap fiat for USDT thay cannot use USDT for banking utils like making credit card payments.

Had there been a way to attribute $1 of fiat dollars underlying USDT on-chain, new kinds of decentralised currencies could be built where not only the crypto but also the underlying fiat assets are in users control.

### Solution

Asset backed token protocol as an infrastructure layer between blockchains & dapps that can attribute real world assets to their on-chain tokens & contracts. The ABT protocol consists of an asset validation layer that can uniquely attribute a real world asset on-chain using zero-knowledge proofs along with a decentralised banking layer that can attribute fiat money to on-chain tokens with a deed bank contract integrated to traditional banking rails. The banking layer works like an on-chain bank account carrying all utilities of a fiat like dollar attribute to decentralised currencies & this layer has potential use case for every dapp existing now or that will exist in future.
